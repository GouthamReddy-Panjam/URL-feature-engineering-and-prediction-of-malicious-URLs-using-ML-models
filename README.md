# URL feature engineering and prediction of malicious URLs using ML models #

## Approach ##
Below mentioned are the steps involved in the completion of this project

1. Extraction of features from URLs.

   * Gather data from open-source platforms containing phishing and trustworthy websites.
   * Create a program to extract the necessary characteristics from the URL database.
   * Using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data preprosessing methods analyze and preprocess the datase
 
2. Training with current URL dataset.

   * Separate the dataset into two parts: training and testing.
   * Apply selected machine learning and deep neural network techniques to the dataset, such as SVM, Random Forest, Decision tree, Multilayer perceptron and XGBoost.
  
3. Accuracy and performance measurement.

   * Develop code to present the assessment result while taking accuracy metrics into account.
   * Compare the outcomes produced for trained models and determine which is better, by visualizing and accuracy comparison.
  
4. Detection of new unknown URL.
   
   * Ask user for new URL
   * Repeat the steps 1,2,3 and get the prediction whether it is malicious or not.
  
 ## Implementation and Resuly analysis etc. are attached in the respective repository in the form as PDF.
